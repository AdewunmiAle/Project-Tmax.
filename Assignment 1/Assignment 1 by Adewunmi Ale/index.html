    <h1>Why Japa is not good for the Growth of Nigeria</h1>
    <h2>What is JAPA?</h2>
    <P><B>JAPA</B> is a slang which originated from the south western part of Nigeria. Literally known as the yorubaâ€™s. the phrase connotes running away from preserved unpleasant situation.</P>
    <p>According to the Nigeria bureau of statistic,80million of the over 200 million population comprises of the youth while over 64% of them are unemployed. This demography depicts Nigeria as a youthful country while unemployment as been a major issue in Nigeria, the supply of welling and able talent to take up the very few jobs available have kept increasing. This has given employers a leverage for cheap labor.</p>
    <p>Why the world is a global village, these youth are aware of their value and worth of the skills they posses outside the country. The covid 19 pandemic has provided a leverage in the Western countries to open their doors for skilled immigrants to work and students to study while they work. this opportunity however is enterprising to people in the 3rd world country whose currency value is of great parity against other currencies like us dollar, euro, pounds.</p>
    <p>In the year 2020 Nigeria saw over 80000 of its youth migrate for greener pasture, in the year 2021 over 120000 Nigerians relocated to countries like <b>U.K, CANADA, USA</b>. As at the first quarter of 2022 over 150000 Nigerians have relocated and the numbers promises to increase, one important thing to note is that majority of those migrating are those in the tech industry, banking, health and entertainment industry. The effect of this labor loss has significantly affected in all of the industry.</p>
    <P>In the second and third quarter of 2022 the Nigeria banking sector cried out on how this talent loss has affected the performance of their product, most importantly their digitals e.g mobile apps ,ussd, internet banking. The health sectors are also affected in the sense that hospitals are short of staffs like doctors and nurses which the effect is increase in number of lost life each day. </P>
    <p> <i>Japa is not for the weak as it ivolves not just money but lots of money</i></p>
